# Test Images for ChatGPTEthGenAPI

This directory should contain test images for the ethnicity region analysis. Each image should be named according to the expected region it represents:

- `europe.jpg` - An image of a person from Europe
- `africa.jpg` - An image of a person from Africa
- `asia.jpg` - An image of a person from Asia
- `south_america.jpg` - An image of a person from South America

## Image Requirements

1. Each image should be a clear, front-facing portrait of a single person
2. Images should be in JPG format
3. Images should be of reasonable size (recommended: 500KB-2MB)
4. Images should be representative of the region they're named for

## Usage

The test suite will automatically use these images to verify that the ChatGPTEthGenAPI correctly identifies the geographic origin of the person in each image.

## Note

Make sure to use appropriate, respectful images that are either:
- Public domain
- Properly licensed
- Your own images
- Images you have permission to use

Do not commit actual images to version control. Instead, add this README and create a `.gitkeep` file to maintain the directory structure.
