    1. Ensure differentiation between goods, services, IT goods & services, and professional services based on standard industry classification definitions
    2. Each NAICS code should she be mapped to one of the above industry codes. 
    2. Prioritize accuracy. Given descriptions do not necessarily need to correspond with given industry codes.
    4. Only assign other, if no industry codes have been assigned
    6. If an industry code has already been assigned in an earlier JSON item, similar naics codes (first 4 digits) should be left out of the final output
    7. Trades are not professional services. Do not assign NAICS codes in these instances.
    8. Goods and/or services imply a company sells to an end-user. Manufacturers may not always be goods or services.
